# Choropleth Map

In this project I create a choropleth map to display the percentage of adults with age of 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher and how they are distributed in the USA.
This project is from the freeCodeCamp course, and it's made with D3.js library.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/choropleth-map.git
```

Go inside the **bar_chartchoropleth-map** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/choropleth-map/).


## Main features

* In this project I used D3.js version 5.
* You can mouse hover an area of the map (each area corresponds to a specific county) and see a tooltip which displays more information about that specific area.
* There is a legend that correlates a specific color to the percentage of adults with age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
